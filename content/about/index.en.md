> Hi ‚úã I'm **Manuel Alfaro**

‚ùì I'am Software Developer so I decided writte a blog to record my learning and share it with you,  ademas me sirve como recordario. it also is a reminder about what I'm learning


üìñ I taked a course at [LaunchX](https://launchx.rocks/) from [@innovaccionvirtual](https://www.instagram.com/innovaccionvirtual/) powered by Microsoft and one of my mentors was [@Carlogilmar](https://www.instagram.com/carlogilmar_/) who motivated us to start a blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) technology.



Because I'm Software Developer, I will write about coding topics and everything I can do in my job.
